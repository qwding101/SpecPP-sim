# SpecPP-sim

This repository contains the R code used to reproduce the results in **Ding et al. (2025)**, which focuses on methodological evaluation through simulation studies. It includes the following folders:

- `data/` contains the simulated datasets (along with the code used to generate them) and the BCI dataset.  
- `func/` contains custom R functions used throughout this repository.  
- `estimate/` contains the code for computing the pseudo-spectrum in our simulation models.  
- `compile/` contains the code for generating the tables and figures presented in the paper.  

For readers who are primarily interested in **applying our statistical method to real-world datasets**, please refer to the companion repository [**SpecPP**](https://github.com/qwding101/SpecPP).
